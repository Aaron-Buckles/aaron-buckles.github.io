<h3>Gerry Minor's Fine Art</h3>
<a href="/gerry-minors-fine-art" target="_blank">Click here to check it out</a>
<p>My grandma wanted a way to share all of her drawings and paintings with her friends. I figured it was a good project to get 
  real world experience working with a client. This project has improved my skills working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>

<p>This was my first time creating an AI for a game. I wrote the AI in JavaScript using depth-first search. It was very difficult 
  to wrap my head around how AI's and DFS works, but I finally got it to function properly. I still have a lot to learn
  and understand. Have fun trying to beat it! ;)<p>
    
<h3>Modular Multiplication</h3>

<p>I saw this on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXUUClgd-Eo">youtube video</a> and decided to recreate it myself. The points slider changes how many points are around the circle. The multiplier slider tells the program where to draw a line to. For example, if the multiplier is 2 then point 3 will draw a line to point 6. Some cool patterns will emerge!<p>
  
<h3>Solitaire</h3>

<p>I created solitaire the card game in python using pygame. I challenge I had at the time was creating the undo/redo system. I eventually made it work by saving only the essential data of the game state. The fact that this is a single player game made it much more enjoyable to test. Have fun!</p>
