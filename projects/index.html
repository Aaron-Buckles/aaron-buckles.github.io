  <h2>Gerry Minor's Fine Art</h2>
  <a href="/gerry-minors-fine-art" target="_blank">Click here to check it out</a>
  <p>My grandma wanted a way to share all of her drawings and paintings with her friends. I figured it was a good project to get 
    real world experience working with a client. This project has improved my skills working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

  <h2>Games on itch.io</h2>
  <a href="https://itch.io/profile/buck1e5" target="_blank">Click here to see my profile page</a>
  <p>This is where I host the video games I worked on. At the moment all of my games on itch.io have been built using the Unity game engine. I was the team lead and a programmer for "Herlock Sholmes". I was a programmer for "LitestD". Both of these games were created while in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/vgdcuci/home" target="_blank">Video Game Development Club (VGDC)</a> at UC Irvine. This club splits its members into teams to work on quarter-long games. There are also various workshops throughout the year. "Light Ranger" was created in a one-week game jam. I was the only one who worked on it.</p>

<h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
  <a href="/tic-tac-toe">Click here to play</a>
  <p>This was my first time creating an AI for a game. I wrote the AI in JavaScript using depth-first search. It was very difficult 
    to wrap my head around how AI's and DFS works, but I finally got it to function properly. I still have a lot to learn
    and understand. Have fun trying to beat it! ;)</p>

  <h2>Modular Multiplication</h2>
  <a href="/modular-multiplication">Click here to check it out</a>
  <p>I saw this on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXUUClgd-Eo">youtube video</a> and decided to recreate it myself. The points slider changes how many points are around the circle. The multiplier slider tells the program where to draw a line to. For example, if the multiplier is 2 then point 3 will draw a line to point 6. Some cool patterns will emerge!</p>

  <h2>Solitaire</h2>
  <a href="/solitaire">Click here to check it out</a>
  <p>I created solitaire the card game in python using pygame. I challenge I had at the time was creating the undo/redo system. I eventually made it work by saving only the essential data of the game state. The fact that this is a single player game made it much more enjoyable to test. Have fun!</p>
